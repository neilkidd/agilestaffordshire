Some things don&#8217;t have actions, just the discussion is enough.<\/li>\n<li>When the timebox is up, the discussion comes to a close and no further points are discussed &#8211; if a point was not discussed this time, and it reoccurs for next time, it is likely that it will get discussed. Only points that the whole group deem important will be discussed so no one person will get to dictate the course of improvement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Variations<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you find that you don&#8217;t have time for 3 points, try just 2, or try extended your timebox.<\/li>\n<li>If you find you are not covering enough items then try taking the top 5 &#8211; be aware though, that your goal is to raise actionable points from the issues raised, so ensure you only cover what is likely to be actionable before the next meeting.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t make the timebox too long as people lose concentration and other stakeholders think you are wasting time in meetings. Keeping the discussion focussed and producing action points mean that other stakeholders (managers etc) can see the results of the meeting, and if you follow up on the action points, they can see the improvements being made.<\/li>\n<li>Give it a go, if it doesn&#8217;t work, have a retrospective retrospective &#8211; what went wrong, what can you improve, what went well?
