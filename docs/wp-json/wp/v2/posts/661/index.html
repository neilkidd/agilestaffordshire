To briefly explain, the challenge comprises a\u00a0fast cycle of iterations (about 10 minutes each), where each pair delivers the requirements as per the specification and acceptance tests.<\/p>\n<p>One might say the challenge is intentionally trivial, but it&#8217;s a great exercise\u00a0because it neatly encapsulates many of the challenges in software development; especially in a rapidly changing context. Producing some code to address the problem was relatively simple, but how about the Lean principles? For convenience, I list the points that the group\u00a0considered:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliminate Waste<\/li>\n<li>Focus on value<\/li>\n<li>Deliver fast<\/li>\n<li>Decide late<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The exercise prompted a valuable, albeit short, discussion of the Lean principles in regards to software development. In particular, where the Lean manufacturing and engineering principles perhaps do note related directly to software. Specific topics of note:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waste is not simple to recognise\/define\u00a0in regards to software.<\/li>\n<li>Development environment \/ platform \/ tools matter &#8211; especially version control.<\/li>\n<li>Is there an upfront design \/ deliver fast trade-off? How would we know?<\/li>\n<li>Context matters. Producing a car for\u00a0a fixed and familiar\u00a0environment. A car does not eventually turn into an aeroplane.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We have a lot to think about for our future sessions. Our post-exercise discussion could benefit from more time. We had a super\u00a0turn out this month and some great\u00a0ideas. I look forward to seeing everyone in June! Lean code gave plenty of food for thought.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s great to consider concepts around a practical challenge.
