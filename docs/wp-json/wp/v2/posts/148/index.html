The beer was pretty good too.<\/p>\n<h2>Backbone.js<\/h2>\n<p>In the modern web, great usabilty is vital. I believe Ed Yourdon (<a title=\"Ed Yourdon's twitter page\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/yourdon\">@yourdon<\/a>) recently suggested that User Experience is as important a differentiator between websites \/ services as Transactions Per Minute was in the 90s.<\/p>\n<p>Users are getting more sophisticated and more demanding. Web developers are embracing and pushing the boundaries of client side scripting to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>improve responsiveness<\/li>\n<li>increase scalability<\/li>\n<li>enable great user experiences<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This has provided difficulties in the past, Javascript has had it&#8217;s challenges &#8211; accessibility, performance, cross browser issues and lack of suggested architectures. There have been some great libraries (Prototype, jQuery) to address some of these concerns. I&#8217;ve still struggled with how to apply consistent structure to Javascript heavy applications.<\/p>\n<p>Several months ago, I watched<a title=\"Single Page Apps and the Future of History\" href=\"http:\/\/www.infoq.com\/presentations\/Single-Page-Apps\"> Single Page Apps and the Future of History<\/a> by <a title=\"Michael Mahemoff's home page\" href=\"http:\/\/mahemoff.com\/\">Michael Mahemoff<\/a>. It&#8217;s a great intro to the subject of Javascript centred web applications and the idea of client side templates, hashbang uri&#8217;s and frameworks like Backbone.js.<\/p>\n<p>In this practical exercise I will introduce <a title=\"Backbone.js\" href=\"http:\/\/backbonejs.org\">Backbone.js<\/a> using underscore templates. Some Javascript knowledge is assumed but we can pair up accordingly. Also, please bring laptops with your favourite Javascript\/html\/text editor. I&#8217;ll be uploading the exercise to GitHub later this week, but will also bring the exercise on a memory stick.<\/p>\n<h2>Lightning Talks<\/h2>\n<p>As yet (usual!) their are no volunteers for a lightning talk. If you have any topic you&#8217;d like to share with the group then you can have a 10 minute slot at the beginning of the meeting. Please email the group or mention it at the venue before we start.<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you there,<br \/>\nPaul Williams<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Details Date: Monday 26th March 2012 Time: 7:15pm start to 9:15pm Location:\u00a0http:\/\/themorrismanpub.co.uk Google Maps:\u00a0http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/ptzt5 Theme: Practical Session &nbsp; New Venue Please note the new venue.
