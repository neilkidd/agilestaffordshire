This is great fun and pretty addictive.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t write too much about it as all the info is at the site linked above. In short you need to program JSON restful requests against a web based service to obtain questions and submit results. It is language agnostic so bring along your laptops and favoured envronment. We will organise the structure of the challenge on the evening.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Alien Invasion<\/h2>\n<p>Some time back, Paul Williams ran <a href=\"http:\/\/agilestaffordshire.org\/?p=98\">a session<\/a> where we programmed against a web API. The code for the project was originally written as a test bed for a tool called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncrunch.net\/\">NCrunch<\/a>. The upshot of this is that the client section of the software is a .net dll. A number of session attendees raised the point that the .net dependency was a pain and it would be better to be language agnostic. In our <a href=\"http:\/\/agilestaffordshire.org\/?p=224\" target=\"_blank\">ideas session<\/a> we have listed &#8220;lets do a project together&#8221; &#8211; well here is an idea. We can refactor the alien invasion code to be all server side and maybe restful.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Williams has offered to put together a few slides. We can then discuss the project, with a view to development practices, infrastructure and so on. Bring your ideas.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>See you there<\/p>\n<p>Neil<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Date: Thursday 25th October 2012 Time: 7:30pm start Venue: The Stafford Ale House Location: Google Maps Minisculus Challenge The Minisculus Challenge is a web based programming challenge originally written for the Software Craftsmanship 2010 meetup.
