He&#8217;ll show us the production and test code, and explain design\u00a0decisions he&#8217;s made. Hopefully this will\u00a0illustrate\u00a0how\u00a0Agile software development techniques can improve games development by reducing close coupling, driving a better API and promoting the correct level of abstraction.<\/p>\n<h2>Exercise<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll try and get 90 minutes for the programming part of the meeting so that we can try a kata with a few more issues to solve. Having discussed the best kata to use for this session with a few people we&#8217;ve selected &#8220;Back to the Checkout&#8221; from Dave Thomas: \u00a0<span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;\"><\/p>\n<p style=\"display: inline !important;\"><a href=\" http:\/\/codekata.pragprog.com\/2007\/01\/kata_nine_back_.html\">http:\/\/codekata.pragprog.com\/2007\/01\/kata_nine_back_.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This involves producing a supermarket checkout application that takes a number of price reduction offers. The exercise starts with a simple &#8220;scan&#8221; method that is called again and again when the checkout operative passes a product over the bar code scanner. The way the bill is produced is open ended, but the system needs take into account offers like &#8220;buy one get on free&#8221;, &#8220;buy two get on free&#8221; etc which are represented in the post as lists of SKUs (stock keeping units).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve chosen this kata because the final solution has some interesting problems to solve regarding the coupling of the classes produced. As we&#8217;re still introducing TDD to some people I believe this will illustrate that test driving code can produce a better API with better separation of behaviour in addition to providing the benefits of security, communication and confidence to change that we have already seen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Details Date: Tues 26th April 2011 Time: 7:15pm start to a 9:15pm (doors open at 6:30pm and close when the till&#8217;s full) Location:\u00a0http:\/\/www.pieandale.com Theme:\u00a0Test Driven Development Talk A short talk from Shaun Finglas about his experiences in developing a version of Pong using test driven development, object oriented design principles, CRC and dependency injection.
