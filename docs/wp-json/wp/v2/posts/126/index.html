His proposal email was as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>My proposal is simply Code Golf. We&#8217;ll spend an hour (ish) solving a fairly trivial problem in the style of a kata as normal. The twist is you must then refactor your code to an extreme level so that you can solve the problem in the least amount of characters possible.<\/p>\n<p>Rules:<br \/>\n&#8211; The code must compile\/execute<br \/>\n&#8211; You can use any language you want as long as you can accept user input\/display output &#8211; think simple console application<br \/>\n&#8211; The code must implement the required functionality<\/p>\n<p>The challenge will be revealed on the night so there is no prerequisites apart from laptops. The more laptops we have the better. People can work solo\/pair if they want but as long as we have enough machines we should be fine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Golfing&#8221; real life production code is not something you would want to do, but I&#8217;ve found Code Golf challenges very fun, and they show just what sort of merciless refactoring you can do once you have a good suite of tests to back you up. These sort of challenges are incredibly hard without a good suite of tests, so you can often win over people who maybe do not see the value in unit testing production code.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Lightning Talks<\/h2>\n<p>As yet (usual!) their are no volunteers for a lightning talk. If you have any  topic you&#8217;d like to share with the group then you can have a 10 minute  slot at the beginning of the meeting. Please email the group or mention  it at the venue before we start.<\/p>\n<p>Hope to see you there,<br \/>\nNeil Kidd<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Details&nbsp; Date: Tuesday 28th February 2012 Time: 7:15pm start to 9:15pm .
