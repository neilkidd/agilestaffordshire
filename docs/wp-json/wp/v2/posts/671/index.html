This month we are going to take a look at\u00a0it ourselves, try out some different approaches and share our experiences.<\/p>\n<p>For me it all started about 2 months ago when I watched Ian Cooper&#8217;s talk on <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/68375232\">TDD, Where did\u00a0it all go wrong<\/a>. I&#8217;ve been told over and over, that\u00a0unit testing gives you the freedom to change code with the safety of\u00a0maintaining\u00a0functionality\u00a0for the customer. So\u00a0refactoring is the process of changing code without changing functionality, and those like Kent Beck would advocate your test suites allow you to safety refactor to design patterns as they emerge in the system. Yet this\u00a0video struck a chord, I struggle to refactor code without breaking tests, and so\u00a0lose confidence that the\u00a0functionality is unchanged as the tests are now different. \u00a0Ian&#8217;s\u00a0video addresses these points\u00a0by highlighting different approaches and definitions to unit testing, and asks is the way some\u00a0of use do TDD slowing us down.<\/p>\n<p>We are going to explore this issue by scratching an itch many of you had during last months lean coding challenge, Refactoring!\u00a0After a quick summary of Ian&#8217;s video,\u00a0we are going to pair up and\u00a0refactor\u00a0a completed C# implementation of last months Checkout Code Challenge. It will be covered by two test suites. One set focusing on implementation per method\u00a0and another suite on behaviour of the system. After an hour of coding we will break for a retrospective\u00a0to find out\u00a0how everyone&#8217;s\u00a0refactoring was influenced by the\u00a0different test suites, the advantages each way of testing has to offer and insights into TDD for agile development.<\/p>\n<p>As we&#8217;re going to be writing code in C#, bring your laptop with visual studio set up &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/JonathanWillis\/LeanCodeRefactor\">Project Code on GitHub<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, please sign up on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Agile-Staffordshire\/\">meetup.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>See you there!<\/p>\n<p>Jon Willis<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Date:\u00a0Thursday 26th June\u00a02014 Time:\u00a019:00 Venue:\u00a0Staffordshire University \u2013 Stafford Campus\u00a0(Octagon building, K102) Fear not, TDD is not dead, although\u00a0it&#8217;s certainly been talked to death this month.
