I really enjoy picking up a new language and playing with it. Every single breakthrough changes your world and feels like a giant leap in understanding. I believe to be quite addictive. I know some members of the group have had some experience with functional-first programming languages and felt obviously at ease with the differences to our usual weapon of choice &#8211; object oriented programming. Others were like me, arriving at the subject without any information. I know it is good to have a fresh perspective, but sometimes I think we need to organise sessions to develop fresh perspectives more often. There&#8217;s a big difference between appreciating other perspectives and having them. I left the session with a buzz, eager to figure out how I could use the material and make something real!<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to our <a href=\"https:\/\/agilestaffordshire.org\/agile\/august-the-guilded-rose-kata\/\">August session &#8211; The Gilded Rose kata<\/a>.
