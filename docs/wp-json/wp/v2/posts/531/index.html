We didn&#8217;t follow the normal retro questions &#8211; what&#8217;s gone well, what can be improved etc.<\/p>\n<p>Rather, we brainstormed future session ideas, tabled the possibility of changing venues. We&#8217;ve been challenged on how to attract new members and speakers and pondered the symbiotic relationships between them.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re currently moving all the great ideas from a mind map into two Trello hosted <a title=\"Agile Staffs on Trello\" href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/agilestaffordshire1\" target=\"_blank\">kanban boards<\/a>. The key areas discovered were future sessions and marketing &#8211; you will find a board for each area. If you would like to contribute to the boards, simply let myself or Neil know your Trello username and you&#8217;ll be added.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, we&#8217;re moving back to basics with subject matter &#8211; more TDD, more pairing. In particular, more sessions on experiences &#8211; how agile does \/ doesn&#8217;t work. However learning evolves etc. Also, more lightning talks etc to promote collaboration and introducing new ideas.<\/p>\n<p>As a tactical move to promote Agile Staffordshire at other community events, Neil and myself are sorting t-shirts to wear at <a title=\"Software Craftsmanship 2013\" href=\"http:\/\/www.codemanship.co.uk\/softwarecraftsmanship\/\">Software Craftsmanship<\/a>. Neil &#8211; order me a large!!<\/p>\n<p>Finally we plan to get blog posts out earlier, with a session follow up post each month followed soon after by a post promoting the next session.
